            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project served as the ME 338 Engineering Design Project, where teams were tasked
              with designing and building a remote-controlled vehicle to meet a defined set of
              performance requirements and demonstrate compliance through testing and competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              I approached the project as a complete mechanical system, translating requirements
              into design targets, building for repeatable assembly, and iterating based on test
              results until both performance and reliability were consistently achieved.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Requirements & Verification Plan</h2>
            <p>
              Early in the project, course requirements were converted into measurable engineering
              targets that could be validated through structured testing rather than subjective
              evaluation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mapped course requirements to quantitative performance targets</li>
              <li>Defined repeatable test procedures to evaluate speed and control</li>
              <li>Used design reviews to lock interfaces and reduce late-stage rework</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mechanical Design</h2>
            <p>
              The primary mechanical challenge was packaging the drivetrain, steering, and electronics
              into a chassis that maintained alignment, allowed fast servicing, and minimized mass.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed the chassis around fixed drivetrain reference planes</li>
              <li>Planned assembly so major components could be removed independently</li>
              <li>Used CAD to manage tolerances, clearances, and fastener access before fabrication</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Drivetrain & Controls</h2>
            <p>
              Vehicle performance was driven largely by drivetrain decisions, particularly gearing
              and alignment under load.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Selected gear ratios to balance torque and top speed for the race course</li>
              <li>Designed mounts to maintain gear mesh through vibration and impacts</li>
              <li>Routed wiring and electronics to minimize failures during operation</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Testing & Race Performance</h2>
            <p>
              The truck was validated through repeated testing cycles, with early failures used to
              guide targeted design improvements ahead of the final race.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ran repeated tests to confirm performance and durability</li>
              <li>Resolved test failures through focused design changes</li>
              <li>Vehicle completed testing and final race without major issues</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Problems Solved & What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Translating requirements into testable engineering targets</li>
              <li>Managing mechanical interfaces to preserve alignment through iterations</li>
              <li>Recognizing how drivetrain packaging decisions affect long-term reliability</li>
              <li>Using structured testing to drive design changes</li>
              <li>Documenting design decisions so the system can be rebuilt by others</li>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
              This project represented a complete mechanical design cycle from requirements through
              competition. The final vehicle met course objectives, performed reliably in testing
              and racing, and was supported by a full documentation package that captured the
              engineering decisions and validation process end to end.
