            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project was the ME 338 Engineering Design Project where we built a remote-controlled vehicle to
              meet a defined set of performance requirements and then prove it through structured testing and a
              final race. I treated it like a real product cycle: translate requirements into design targets,
              build a system that can be assembled repeatedly, then iterate until performance and reliability
              were both solid.
            </p>
            <p>
              The truck performed well in testing and in the final race, and the final documentation package
              captures the requirements, design decisions, and verification results.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Requirements & Verification Plan</h2>
            <p>
              The first step was turning the course prompt into engineering targets that could be validated
              with tests, not opinions. The TRR and design reviews captured what the vehicle had to do and
              how we planned to prove it.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mapped requirements to measurable targets like speed, control, and repeatability</li>
              <li>Defined test procedures that could be repeated run-to-run</li>
              <li>Used the reviews to lock interfaces, reduce risk, and prevent late rework</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Mechanical Design</h2>
            <p>
              The core mechanical problem was packaging a drivetrain and electronics into a chassis that was
              stiff enough to hold alignment, serviceable enough to repair quickly, and light enough to
              perform well.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed the chassis layout around drivetrain alignment and clean mounting references</li>
              <li>Planned assembly so components could be swapped without disassembling the whole car</li>
              <li>Used CAD to control tolerances, clearances, and fastener access before printing parts</li>
            </ul>

            <figure class="project-plot-thumb">
              <img src="img/kei-chassis.jpg" alt="Photo of the chassis during assembly" />
              <figcaption>Placeholder for a mid-build photo that shows the chassis and mounting layout</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Drivetrain & Controls</h2>
            <p>
              A big portion of performance came down to drivetrain choices. I focused on making sure the
              gearing and layout could deliver usable torque while still reaching the target speed.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Selected gearing based on target speed and expected loading during the race course</li>
              <li>Designed mounts and interfaces to keep gear mesh and alignment consistent</li>
              <li>Packaged wiring and electronics to reduce failures during vibration and impacts</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Testing & Race Performance</h2>
            <p>
              We validated the vehicle through the course test plan and used early test results to drive
              improvements before final competition.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ran repeated test cycles to confirm performance and durability</li>
              <li>Fixed issues found in testing with targeted design changes instead of full redesigns</li>
              <li>Vehicle performed reliably through testing and the final race</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>How to translate requirements into design targets you can actually test</li>
              <li>How to manage interfaces so assembly stays repeatable even after iterations</li>
              <li>How drivetrain alignment and packaging decisions show up as reliability problems later</li>
              <li>How to use structured testing to drive changes instead of guessing</li>
              <li>How to document decisions clearly enough that someone else can rebuild the system</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
              This project was a full mini product cycle: requirements, design reviews, build, verification, and
              competition. The final truck met the course intent and performed well in testing and the final race,
              and the TRR, CDR, and FDR capture the engineering tradeoffs and validation approach end to end.
