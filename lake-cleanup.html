            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Central Texas lakes are collecting plastic litter and tire-wear particles, especially
              along brush-filled shorelines where existing cleanup boats can’t maneuver safely.
              Our Lake Guardians team set out to design a small, deployable system that can reach
              those pockets, corral floating plastics, and hand debris off to existing crews instead
              of replacing them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over two semesters, we’ve treated this as a full design-methodology case study:
              interviewing stakeholders from the City of Austin and UT research groups, translating
              quotes into customer needs, building engineering specifications and a House of
              Quality, then using structured concept generation and selection to arrive at a
              remotely operated airboat with a front comb bulldozer mechanism.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Design Methodology</h2>
            <p>
              This project is less about a single cool prototype and more about doing the design
              process correctly end-to-end. We:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Conducted solution-neutral interviews and field observations, then converted
                raw quotes into interpreted needs, engineering requirements, and ranked
                specifications
              </li>
              <li>
                Built a <strong>House of Quality</strong> that benchmarked Mr. Trash Wheel, StormX
                Netting Trap, and Seabin, then used that to set target metrics for capture
                performance, ecological safety, and ease of maintenance
              </li>
              <li>
                Used <strong>function decomposition</strong> to break “remove plastics from lakes” into
                eight primary functions like intercepting floating plastics, protecting wildlife,
                retaining debris, enabling modular deployment, and informing the public
              </li>
              <li>
                Ran multiple ideation methods (6-3-5 brainwriting, design-by-analogy,
                SCAMPER) and captured those ideas in a morphological matrix and five fully
                defined concept variants
              </li>
              <li>
                Evaluated concepts with rotating-datum <strong>Pugh charts</strong>, backed by
                quick “back-of-the-envelope” calculations for throughput, capacity, cost, and
                maintenability
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The outcome of all that structure was a clear, defensible choice: an airboat
              concept that balanced plastic removal, wildlife safety, cost, and maintainability
              better than drones, floating channels, or hand tools.

            <h2>Leading Concept: Airboat Cleanup System</h2>
            <p>
              The final concept is a small airboat that pushes trash instead of sucking water:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Above-water propulsion:</strong> a rear fan and rudder system mounted entirely
                above the waterline to avoid vegetation jams and protect wildlife
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Front comb bulldozer:</strong> a wide rake that funnels floating plastics out of
                brushy shorelines into access zones where crews can collect them
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Modular hull:</strong> stacked XPS foam panels with an epoxy skin, sized for a
                2 ft × 1 ft footprint so the boat is stable, portable, and cheap to build
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Swap-in modules:</strong> a removable comb assembly, electronics pod, and
                propulsion module so parts can be upgraded or replaced without rebuilding the
                hull
              </li>
            </ul>

  <h2>Prototyping &amp; Risk Reduction</h2>
  <p>
    Before spending real money on electronics, we built low-fidelity prototypes for the
    two riskiest subsystems: the comb and the hull.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Comb prototype:</strong> PVC frame and paint-stick “teeth” tested in brushy,
      lake-like conditions with bottles and wrappers. This validated the geometry for
      pushing debris through vegetation and exposed obvious failure modes like tooth
      breakage and weak attachments
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Foam hull PoC:</strong> a bathtub-tested insulation-foam hull with a toy fan
      to confirm buoyancy, stability, and deck geometry before committing to a full
      epoxy-coated build
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>FMEA:</strong> quantified risk around vegetation jams, electronics flooding,
      and RC signal loss, then drove concrete mitigations like a wiper system on the comb,
      sealed electronics enclosures, and antenna placement changes
    </li>
  </ul>

            <h2>Design for Manufacturing &amp; Assembly</h2>
            <p>
              A big chunk of this project was learning to design for the shop we actually have,
              not the shop we wish we had. I leaned heavily on DFMA heuristics while revising
              the CAD:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Manufacturing:</strong> re-designed the hull around flat XPS sheets and simple
                2D cuts; converted the comb from many unique tines into a small set of repeated
                laser-cut panels; and selected common materials (foam, plywood, PVC,
                aluminum) that can be manufactured in student shops
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assembly:</strong> reduced part count, consolidated bolt sizes, and added
                self-locating features and press-fit interfaces so the boat can be assembled
                top-down with simple hand tools
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Documentation:</strong> created detailed assembly drawings, an assembly plan,
                and a BOM that someone else could realistically follow without our whole
                report as a crutch
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Responsibilities &amp; What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
              This project forced me to live inside a structured
              design process for months and keep the team moving. Key things I owned and
              learned:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Design process discipline:</strong> keeping our work traceable from customer
                quotes → interpreted needs → engineering specs → design artifacts (function
                tree, HoQ, morph matrix, Pugh charts) → final concept
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk-aware design:</strong> using FMEA as a real design tool instead of a
                checkbox, then folding those risks back into geometry changes, enclosure
                decisions, and control-system failsafes
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>DFMA mindset:</strong> learning to simplify geometry, standardize parts, and
                design fasteners and interfaces so that volunteers—not just engineers—can
                assemble and maintain the system
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Project planning:</strong> maintaining the Gantt chart and task list, breaking
                ambiguous deliverables into concrete tasks, and making sure our design work
                aligned with the course milestones and the two-semester roadmap
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Communicating decisions:</strong> packaging all of this into clear reports and
                presentations so faculty, stakeholders, and future teams can understand why we
                chose an airboat, how it meets specs, and where to iterate next
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Impact &amp; Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
              By the end of the CDR, we have more than just a sketch: we have a justified, manufacturable
              airboat concept with drawings, risk mitigations, and a build plan. Next semester
              we’ll fabricate a medium-fidelity prototype, validate thrust and steering on the water,
              stress-test the comb in real vegetation, and close the loop with the researchers and
              city partners who helped shape the specs.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is the bridge between classroom design tools and the messy,
              constrained reality of environmental hardware: taking a vague goal like “clean the
              lake,” grinding it through formal design methodology, and ending up with something
              real that crews can deploy.
