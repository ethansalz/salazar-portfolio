            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Longhorn Racing needed a low-cost way to log vehicle dynamics and thermal data
              during kart and car testing. Most commercial systems were either too expensive
              or too closed to modify for student research. Our team built a custom telemetry
              system that could be moved between vehicles and output structured CSV data for
              analysis and event classification.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final system combined an IMU, GNSS receiver, and four temperature probes
              with an Arduino Nano ESP32 and a simple serial-to-CSV logging workflow. We
              validated the system on a kart, logging laps and reconstructing the path, speed
              profile, and temperature behavior in post-processing.

            <h2>Hardware Architecture</h2>
            <p>
              We iterated through several breadboard prototypes before settling on a clean,
              compact layout on a long board that could be taped to the kart chassis.
              The final hardware stack included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Arduino Nano ESP32 as the main controller and USB interface</li>
              <li>Adafruit BNO055 9-DoF IMU breakout for orientation and acceleration</li>
              <li>u-blox NEO-M8P GNSS module with an external antenna for position and speed</li>
              <li>Four waterproof digital temperature probes for tire and component temperatures</li>
              <li>Qwiic / I²C cabling to reduce wiring clutter and keep connections robust</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each sensor was selected to balance cost, accuracy, and ease of integration.
              We tested individual components on an Arduino Uno first, then migrated the
              design to the Nano ESP32 once we were confident in performance.

            <h2>Firmware &amp; Data Logging</h2>
            <p>
              On the embedded side, I wrote Arduino code to read all sensors at a consistent
              rate, perform basic unit conversions, and stream a structured line of data over
              serial. The packet included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Millisecond timestamp, latitude, longitude, and GNSS fix quality</li>
              <li>IMU orientation and acceleration values</li>
              <li>Four temperature channels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              On the laptop, I used a simple logger to capture exactly what the board printed
              to the serial port (the same data visible in the Arduino Serial Plotter) and
              write it to a fresh CSV file for each run. I manually started and stopped the
              logger, and used a consistent naming scheme so files could be tied back to
              specific tests at a glance.
            </p>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Software Architecture</h2>
            <p>
              The software side was intentionally kept simple so anyone on the team could run it
              without fighting a complex stack. Everything revolved around a single stream of
              comma-separated values coming off the Nano ESP32:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Embedded loop:</strong> read all sensors, apply basic unit conversions,
                and print one CSV line per sample (millisecond timestamp, GNSS, IMU, and four
                temperature channels) over the serial port.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Serial stream:</strong> the exact same text stream shown in the Arduino
                Serial Plotter, which made debugging and sanity checks straightforward.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Testing &amp; Results</h2>
            <p>
              We first validated the system on the bench, then on a kart at the track.
              The GNSS data was used to reconstruct clockwise and counterclockwise laps and
              compare them to ideal circular paths. Temperature data showed clear trends
              with speed and steering, and IMU data captured transitions and maneuvers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system met our course requirements and produced clean enough data to
              support event classification and further model validation work. The full
              architecture and results are documented in our final report and presentation.

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Problems Solved &amp; What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Architected a complete DAQ pipeline from sensors through ESP32 to CSV logs
                that teammates could analyze without touching the firmware.
              </li>
              <li>
                Debugged noisy IMU and GNSS data, calibration drift, and wiring issues by
                adding warm-up procedures, improving grounding, and cleaning up the layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved logging reliability with a simple, manual logger and a naming
                convention that made test runs easy to track and compare.
              </li>
              <li>
                Learned how to design hardware that survives vibration, heat, and real track
                conditions instead of just working once on a lab bench.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
              The finished telemetry system gave Longhorn Racing a reusable, low-cost tool
              for collecting synchronized IMU, GNSS, and thermal data on karts and test
              vehicles. It has already served as a template for future logging setups and
              provides a foundation for event classification, driver coaching, and model
              validation work going forward.
