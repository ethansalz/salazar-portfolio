            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              PHD Energy needed to understand why some customer packs were seeing elevated
              terminal temperatures in the field. The obvious solution was to buy a professional
              environmental chamber, but that would have cost several thousand dollars and
              taken weeks to procure. Instead, I was asked to “see what we could do” with what
              we already had on hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              I designed and built a high-temperature battery testing chamber from an empty
              LiFePO₄ pack enclosure, a heating pad, foam insulation, and bench-top equipment.
              The chamber can soak packs at controlled ambient temperatures of 45&nbsp;°C and
              65&nbsp;°C, enabling repeatable charge/discharge tests that mirror worst-case field
              conditions while staying within a startup budget.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Chamber Architecture</h2>
            <p>
              The core design challenge was creating a safe, uniform, and controllable thermal
              environment inside a plastic battery enclosure not originally designed as a chamber.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Enclosure:</strong> repurposed a large 25.6&nbsp;V 150&nbsp;Ah LiFePO₄ pack
                housing as the outer shell, giving us built-in terminals, handles, and enough
                volume for a module under test
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Heating system:</strong> mounted a silicone heating pad on the steel base
                plate and routed its leads out through an existing strain-relief, avoiding any new
                penetrations that could compromise safety
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Insulation:</strong> added foam blocks and an interior liner to minimize heat
                loss and keep the plastic walls below damaging temperatures
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Air circulation:</strong> attached two 12&nbsp;V DC fans to the inside of the lid
                to circulate air and reduce hot spots near the heater
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Instrumentation:</strong> ran a thermistor lead into the chamber, taped to the
                interior wall near the pack terminals so readings reflected the actual environment
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Control &amp; Measurement Setup</h2>
            <p>
              Rather than building a full PID controller, I leaned on existing lab equipment and
              simple procedures that technicians could repeat:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Powered the heating pad from a bench DC supply, using voltage and current
                limits to cap heater power and avoid runaway.
              </li>
              <li>
                Used a clamp meter and multimeter to monitor heater draw and pack current
                during tests, verifying that our 30&nbsp;A charge/discharge condition was met.
              </li>
              <li>
                Logged ambient chamber temperature via the thermistor and pack terminal
                temperatures at fixed time intervals into an Excel sheet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a warm-up procedure: soak packs at 45&nbsp;°C for 3–4&nbsp;hours
                before starting charge/discharge cycles to ensure repeatable initial conditions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This “use what’s on the bench” approach kept cost close to zero while still giving
              us professional-grade control over the test environment.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Validation</h2>
            <p>
              With the chamber built, I designed a test plan to isolate the root cause of high
              terminal temperatures on a 12&nbsp;V LFP pack used by a robotics customer. The
              main variables were ambient temperature, connection method, and wire gauge.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Soaked packs at 45&nbsp;°C ambient and ran multiple charge/discharge tests at
                30&nbsp;A, using both alligator clips and screwed-in leads with different wire
                gauges
              </li>
              <li>
                Logged chamber and terminal temperatures over time and exported datasets
                into Excel for plotting and comparison
              </li>
              <li>
                Generated graphs comparing alligator clips vs 8&nbsp;AWG and 10&nbsp;AWG
                screwed leads for both charging and discharging, then summarized the
                trends and max temperatures in a client-facing report
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The data showed that poor connections (alligator clips) caused significantly higher
              terminal temperatures than properly screwed-in leads, and that thicker wire helped
              but connection quality mattered most
            </p>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Problems Solved &amp; What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Built a test chamber from scratch:</strong> turned spare parts—an empty
                enclosure, heater, foam, fans, and a bench supply—into a safe, repeatable
                high-temperature chamber without buying new capital equipment
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Owned the whole pipeline:</strong> design, build, test planning, execution,
                data collection, and analysis all ran through me, which forced me to think
                about safety, repeatability, and usability at every step
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Developed reporting muscle:</strong> translated raw spreadsheets into a clear
                narrative report that explained the setup, showed the key graphs, and made
                concrete recommendations on connection hardware and wire gauge
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Learned to design within constraints:</strong> instead of specifying “ideal”
                equipment, I had to design a workflow that fit PHD’s existing lab, power
                availability, and budget
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved test discipline:</strong> built habits around pre-conditioning packs,
                documenting every configuration, and keeping enough detail that someone
                else can repeat the campaign months later
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
              The improvised chamber eliminated the need to purchase a multi-thousand-dollar
              environmental chamber while still meeting our customer’s requirement to validate
              performance at elevated ambient temperatures. It enabled PHD Energy to run
              structured high-temperature tests on production packs, generate confident
              recommendations on connection hardware, and demonstrate that the root cause
              of high terminal temperatures was connection quality—not the cell design itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as importantly, the chamber is now a permanent tool in the lab. Future
              engineers can drop new packs in, follow the documented procedure, and extend
              validation to new products without additional capital spend.
